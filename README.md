# Cafe Menu

This project is a simple, responsive cafe menu webpage built with HTML and CSS. I created it to learn how to use HTML for structuring content and CSS for styling and layout. The menu features coffee and dessert sections, each with item names, prices, and images. The design is clean, easy to read, and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- Coffee and dessert sections with itemized prices
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Styled with external CSS
- Includes sample images and a footer with address

## How I Built It

I used HTML to organize the menu items and sections, and CSS to style the page, add background images, and make the layout responsive. This project helped me understand how HTML and CSS work together to create a functional and attractive website.

## Usage

Feel free to use or customize this template for your own cafe or restaurant website!
